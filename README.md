# Life Balance

The system we aim to develop is a user-friendly application designed for anyone who wants to organize their time or take control of all aspects of their life, under the concept of organization. After logging into the system, users will experience interactive features, allowing them to set specific goals and deadlines or establish habits (daily, monthly, etc.), with the system reminding users to accomplish their goals at the specified times.

The system focuses on key aspects that users want to organize throughout their lives (social, sports, educational, work, etc.). Our system motivates users through continuous interaction by informing them of the total points for each aspect individually.

One of the key incentives for building the project is our approach to time organization by dividing the main important aspects of each person's life, promoting organized living in all areas. The system achieves this through advertisements and coupons provided to users to encourage their continued engagement.

**Note:** The system is within the scope of Syria and is targeted at all individuals interested in the system concept, as identified through a survey. The interested demographic is in the age range of (18 to 25) and (25 to 35).
